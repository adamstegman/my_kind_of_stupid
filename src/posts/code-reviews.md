An excellent point. Code reviews are valuable for getting eyes on the code, but I agree with Raganwald here that the
more valuable outcome is that everyone shares in the learning. I've thought of that as learning *about* the work that
others are doing, but Raganwald makes a good point that you learn from the *discussion* about the work that others are
doing.
