title: Complex Associations with factory_girl

[`factory_girl`][factory_girl] is great for DRYing up test code and making tests isolated and maintainable. What it's not so great at is any [association][associations] more complicated than `has_one`/`belongs_to`. I found [a nice trick on Stack Overflow][stack_overflow]Â for `has_many` associations.

It's a shame, because it makes it really painful to use factories. What used to be a one-line call to create whatever you need becomes writing your own factories that call `factory_girl` factories.
