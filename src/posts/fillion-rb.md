Yesterday Nathan Fillion [tweeted][tweet] about finding a permutation of his name on a website. At first I just chuckled, but it soon occurred to me that this would be a fun problem to solve with scripting.

So I whipped up [fillion.rb][fillion] to peruse a webpage for permutations of a given word. It was fun to figure out a quick algorithm to find permutations, and then fight scope creep (I ended up writing a crawler for an entire domain).

The beauty of development is being able to look for a challenge anywhere.
