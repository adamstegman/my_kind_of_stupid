It was fun to figure out a quick algorithm to find permutations, and then fight scope creep (I ended up writing a crawler for an entire domain).</p>\n<p>The beauty of development is being able to look for a challenge anywhere.</p>',fields:{post:{title:"fillion.rb",link:"https://gist.github.com/1174851",timestamp:"2011-08-27T01:48Z",date:"August 27, 2011 1:48am UTC"}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/fillion-rb"}}}});
