I don’t know that this is still a problem, but the idea is ridiculous in and of itself. Italic does not\nalways mean emphasis, nor does bold always mean MAKE THIS LOUD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hey, you know, that\'s true. That\'s what <code>&#x3C;b></code> and <code>&#x3C;i></code> should be used for. Here\'s what they <em>shouldn\'t</em> be used for, from the same article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The bold and italic tags are short. The emphasis tag isn’t bad, but the strong tag is way too long to be a good value\nper keystroke.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, semantic HTML uses tags that are longer than one character. <code>&#x3C;strong></code> is five whole more letters than <code>&#x3C;b></code>! Sounds like someone who throws around a lot of "u"instead of "you", and "y" instead of "why" in textual conversations. Not someone I\'d want to take design advice from.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I add <code>&#x3C;b></code> and <code>&#x3C;i></code> to things I don’t necessarily want bolded or italicized. I do it because they’re some of the\nshortest elements available and they provide a hook to style child elements in larger repeated widgets with very\nprecise, complex layouts. If I have to wrap every word of text in a tag just to accomplish some goofy layout, I’m\nusing the smallest thing available.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That sounds like a pretty poor layout.</p>\n<p>Bottom line is, <code>&#x3C;b></code> and <code>&#x3C;i></code> have their place, but it\'s not showing emphasis, nor is it saving keystrokes or because this layout is kinda complicated and I want some easy hooks.</p>',fields:{post:{title:"Defending Terrible Things",link:"http://garann.wordpress.com/2010/06/19/defending-terrible-things/",timestamp:"2010-06-20T05:14Z",date:"June 20, 2010 5:14am UTC"}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/defending-terrible-things"}}}});
