{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>While working on <a href=\"http://adamstegman.com/projects/web-queue.html\">Web Queue</a> today I went to document the URLs to\nhelp me figure out the interface. As I was about to start writing out the URLs,\nI realized I could make it a lot easier on myself by giving the document some\nstructure. So I decided to roll it into the README, which also needed to be\nwritten.</p>\n<p>As I wrote up the README, everything became a bit clearer. Up to that point, I\nhad been fussing over details, learning how to use OAuth and the Netflix API\nwhile poorly maintaining a few different classes. Writing the README allowed me\nto step back and conceive the system as a whole, which made the necessary code\nmuch more clear to me. That's README-driven development.</p>\n<p>My projects often go like this. I'm almost always learning a new technology or\nlibrary, so I can't always start off with a good architecture. But starting\nwith the interface can make things a lot clearer.</p>\n<p>Writing out the URLs for a project is pretty similar to writing the README. It\nhas the same goal, figuring out the interface of a project, but focused on web\napplications instead of any other project. And as I'm learning from personal\nexperience, that can be exactly what's needed for a good project.</p>","fields":{"post":{"title":"URL-Driven Development is README-Driven Development","link":null,"timestamp":"2011-08-06T19:42Z","date":"August 6, 2011 7:42pm UTC"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/url-driven-development-is-readme-driven-development"}}
