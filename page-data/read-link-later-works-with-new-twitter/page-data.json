New Twitter came to me at a bad time, where I didn't have the time to devote to updating Read Link Later. Fortunately, we're in business now!</p>\n<p>The only issue is that the New Twitter uses their own API through JavaScript, so I don't have a way of knowing when a tweet is loaded. To work around this, I look for new tweets to add the Read Later links to every 100 ms. If I could hack in a custom event, that would be something.</p>","fields":{"post":{"title":"Read Link Later Works With New Twitter","link":"https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/mffbgadohiiggcibdgmogfdlmackfbhm","timestamp":"2010-10-20T12:27Z","date":"October 20, 2010 12:27pm UTC"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/read-link-later-works-with-new-twitter"}},
