I recognized it from the headers in the email, and wondered if someone had written a gem or something to decode it. Then I find <a href=\"http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/1.8.7/String#unpack-instance_method\">this</a> - String#unpack was able to do it for me all along.</p>\n<p>It's great that Ruby (and sometimes Rails) can do things like this out of the box.
