I'm excited to publish my first Google Chrome extension, Read Link Later. From the detail page:

> Read Link Later adds an Instapaper "Read Later" link to each tweet in a Twitter.com feed. The link retrieves each external URL in the tweet and adds it to your Instapaper queue for reading later.

Unfortunately I can't add these links to clients, that would be even more helpful.
